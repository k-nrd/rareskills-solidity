# What might Wrapped NFTs be used for?

One could wrap NFTs to add all kinds of overarching functionality. For example:

1. An NFT that had no governance setup could be wrapped in an NFT with a governance ERC20 token.
2. A wrapper contract could wrap several NFTs, letting users deposit a bundle of different NFTs and receiving one in return - effectively creating a derivative NFT that represents that bundle of NFTs.
3. A wrapper could fractionalize the value in an NFT, emitting several ERC20 tokens for each NFT instead of one.
